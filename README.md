This is a personal blog style webpage created for the "first homework assignment" in the JHU FullStack bootcamp
This website features a main index.html page with link to a porfolio.html page and a contact.html page
The portfoio page features images that I, Michael Artes, the creater of this page uploaded from my personal image library.
